# in python there is nothing truly private in Python
# ! we just name them with a double underscore (balance => __balance), to denote it is a private variable 

#* we use getters and setters to implement encapsulation

# encapsulation is the process of hiding data but also making it available when needed 

# python objects are mutable so changes in objects do not change the object address 
#! but we caan make them immutable => https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/immutability-in-python-d57a3b23f336#:~:text=All%20you%20have%20to%20do,instance%20is%20now%20%E2%80%9Cfrozen%E2%80%9D.&text=objects%20become%20immutable.
